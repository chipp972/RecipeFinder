Idea :
DB :
	- new relation : "Stats" that regroups
	 -> its position (rank)
	 -> if it was clicked
	 -> id recipe
	 -> id user

	- add index on user id and recipe id

 R_engine :
(dico) -> {"78%": "id_recipe1", "53%" : "id2"...}

Algo :
	Init :

		-> recipes that were chosen before by the user
			in function of its tastes
		-> his opinions
		-> (his favorites)
		-> recipes that were chosen before by eveybody except user in function of their tastes

	Compute :
		TFIDF

	Return :
		Dictionnary with the recipe ids and the result of the tfidf
